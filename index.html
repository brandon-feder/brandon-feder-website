        Hello. My name is Brandon Feder. I am a high school computer science, programming, 
        and math enthusiest. And this is my website!
    </p>

    <p>
        Ever since my Grandfather showed me some HTML in first grade, I have been interested 
        in computers. I taught myself C++, Java, Python, Javascript and many others. Of course, 
        programming itself is not the exciting part, but instead, what you do with the code. 
        I currently am interested in GPGPU, computational mathmatics, data structures, and 
        algorythms.
    </p>

    <p>
        On this website, I show off my projects, write about my intrests, and otherwise do whaever 
        I feel. If you have any questions, feel free to <b><a href="/contact">contact me</a></b> at brandon.e.feder@gmail.com .
    </p>
